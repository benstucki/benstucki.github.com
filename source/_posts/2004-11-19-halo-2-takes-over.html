	 <strong>Halo 2 Takes Over [ Fri, 19 Nov 2004 12:00:00 PM GMT ]</strong><br/>
     My typically productive spare time has recently been replaced with Halo 2 game play and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050205213346/http://www.benstucki.com/stats/" target="_blank">Halo 2 application</a> development per <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050205213346/http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/006316.cfm" target="_blank">Mike Chamber's contest</a>. I'm sure that some viewers taking a look at the Halo 2 app will migrate to the root domain, so I'm trying to get this in order as well. Thanks to the contest extension, I should have just enough time to get it all up and running. For the record though, my Halo 2 app is complete as of this post.
