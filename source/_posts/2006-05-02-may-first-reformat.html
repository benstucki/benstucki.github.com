title: May First Reformat
layout: post
---
<p>Today, many sites are participating in the <a href="http://www.may1reboot.com/">May First Reboot</a> or the <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS Reboot</a>, but instead of rebooting my site I decided to reformat it. This means that instead of creating a new design, I will be embracing a new methodology for my blog. Each month I'm going to have a common theme for my posts. One month may be entirely about JavaScript, while another month may be about design principles. I think this fits my personal tendency to hop from subject to subject, while still creating some much needed structure for my blog. I will announce new topics on the first of each month and give a brief recap on the last day of each month. Hopefully as I pick up readers interested in a certain topic, I can keep them reading as I transition to the next one.</p>
