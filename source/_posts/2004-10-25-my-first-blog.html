	 <strong>My First Blog [ Mon, 25 Oct 2004 12:00:00 PM GMT ]</strong><br/>
     Welcome to my first blog posting. It seems to be the trendy thing to do these days, and I'm very excited about the potential it represents for getting peer feedback on some of the exciting projects I have coming up. On a side note, I did try using the latest <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050205211721/http://www.veggiani.it/projects/cfxml_blog/" target="_blank">CFXML_Blog</a> version for this first, but after not being able to post or change the unicode settings from Italian I decided it would be worthwhile to create my own blog application. From what I saw, Andrea Veggiani and Giampaolo Bellavite did a great job with their blog application and the error is likely in my remote server's security setup. My custom solution won't be nearly as portable as the CFXML_Blog, but I will keep a zip of it posted for anyone to download and reference.
