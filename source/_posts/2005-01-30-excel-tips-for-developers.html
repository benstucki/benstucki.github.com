     I haven't been making allot of posts lately, as I've been busy with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050324103514/http://www.fusiox.com/" target="_blank">Fusiox.com</a>. However a few blog posts from the Macromedia crowd peaked my interest today. One is titled <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050324103514/http://brajeshwar.com/archives/2005/01/microsoft_offic.php" target="_blank">Microsoft Office Suite</a> and the other is titled <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050324103514/http://www.markme.com/md/archives/006902.cfm" target="_blank">Managing email overload</a>. Indeed, Microsoft Office Suite is often a necessary tool in the business world today. I know that I used Excel, Access or Outlook nearly all day, every day for the better part of two years. I'm even MS Excel 2003 Expert Certified ( yay me ). So at the risk of alienating  hard-core Microsoft bashers, I hope to bring you a few tips and tricks for Excel in the coming weeks. These will be advanced tips on hard-to-find subjects, as I know that basic Excel tips exist in great numbers. Posts will be informal, and a few topics may include 'User Defined Functions', 'Macros for Developers' and 'Excel Add-Ons'. Hopefully these posts will give me a break from the more intense development going on, and I should be posting the first one in just a few days.
