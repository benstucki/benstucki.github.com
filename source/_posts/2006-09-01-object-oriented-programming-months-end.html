title: Object Oriented Programming Months End
layout: post
---
<p>I've been blogging about Object Oriented Programming for several months and so according to my <a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?id=16">blogging format</a> I'm overdue for a subject change. I don't feel like I did the subject of OOP as much justice as it deserves, but I do have some good rough drafts and a better idea of what order these ideas have to be presented in. Hopefully I will make a second pass at editing the posts and expand on the last few at some point in the not too distant future. In case you missed any, they are listed below.</p>

		<li><a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?id=27">Putting the Object in Object Oriented</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?id=28">Building Objects with Class</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?id=29">Looking at Events Objectively</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?id=30">Building Classes with Class</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?id=31">Interfacing with Polymorphism</a></li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>I obviously had a tutorial kind of format going for this subject, but I'll try to get a little more real code and a little less formality in the next few months.</p>
