	 <strong>Unobtrusive JavaScript  Form Validation [ Sat, 19 Feb 2005 01:22:19 PM GMT ]</strong><br/>
	 
		
	 
     I've been reading allot about '<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407001058/http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/" target="_blank">unobtrusive javascript</a>' lately. Stuart Langridge has a popular <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407001058/http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/" target="_blank">table sorting</a> script using unobtrusive javascript, and John Dowdell from Macromedia even gave it a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407001058/http://www.markme.com/jd/archives/006995.cfm" target="_blank">brief mention</a> recently. It looks like it's been around for a while, but I guess it has gotten renewed interest  as the older browsers dissappear. Just like seperation of style and content, it still may not always be applicable for business use yet, but any browser from the past few years should support the js functions needed. Anyways, I thought I should write an unobtrusive javascript file myself, and since I'm also a strong believer in client side form validation, I bring you <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407001058/http://blog.benstucki.net/downloads/validation.zip">validation.js</a>. It provides a few formatting and validation functions for common form inputs such as phone numbers, credit cards, zip codes, etc. I'm honestly at a loss to understand why this type of client side formatting isn't used more often, but now that it's so easy to impliment there should be no excuse. Simply include the .js file and assign the related class to the appropriate input.
