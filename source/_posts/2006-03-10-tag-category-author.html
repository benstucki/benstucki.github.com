<p>I need some help solving an age old mystery. Are categories and tags the the same thing? They're used very differently, but what makes them inherently different? I've got part of my category system up (it still filters all the menus though :-), and I'm trying to keep my database normalized. Building completely separate systems for categories and tags just seems like duplication to me. Twice as many tables mean twice as many stored procedures, objects, methods, etc. It gets complicated. After reading plenty of back and forth arguments on the whole issue, I think I may be on to something. Categories belong to a user and tags do not. I've gone through most of the tagging systems I can think of and haven't found much about user specific tagging. Can anyone point me to a system where tags are specific to users? Campbell, Manish, I know your out there (I'm still working on your commenting suggestions).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've got my categories and tags working now, and I can pretty much take this whole entry back. I'm an idiot.</p>
