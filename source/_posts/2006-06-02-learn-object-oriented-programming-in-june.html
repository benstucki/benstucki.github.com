title: Learn Object Oriented Programming in June
layout: post
---
<p>This month's topic is going to be Object Oriented Programming. I know that there are still a lot of ActionScript, ColdFusion, Visual Basic and PHP developers who are looking for the easiest way to learn OOP. If that's you, keep an eye out for my posts. I'm taking a technology agnostic approach to describing the language and concepts behind OOP, and since I'm not trying to sell you on a specific technology in the process, it should be easier to understand. This will also give me time to prepare for next month's topic and may even improve my technical writing skills in the process. My posts will start with the basics and build from there, so be sure you catch each one.</p>
