title: Observing the First Annual CSS Naked Day
layout: post
---
<p>I'm observing the first <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">Annual CSS Naked Day</a> today by displaying my blog without any CSS styles applied to it. So while we're looking at my XHTML, I thought I would point out a couple of things.</p>

<p>First off, I've been putting my content first and my navigation second. Most people seem to do the opposite, so I'm wondering what the reasoning is either way. Which one is better and why? Second, I'm using a definition list (dl) to organize my forms. I highly recommend it, but I wondered what some arguments against doing this might be. Anyways, feel free to completely rip my markup apart and tell me what I should be doing better.</p>
