<p>No, it's not a new book. It's my itinerary for tomorrow. I'll be attending an <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;EventID=1032287840">MSDN event</a> on SmartClients from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM CST and a <a href="http://www.ncfug.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=dspMeetingInfo">NCFUG meeting</a> at 6:30 PM CST. If you're in the Nashville area, I look forward to seeing you at one or both of these. The NCFUG meeting is open to all, and <a href="http://www.jessewarden.com/archives/2006/02/speaking_on_fle.html">Jesse Warden</a> is going to be presenting on Flex 2. So you really have no excuse to miss that one. Plus, who doesn't like free pizza?</p>
