title: Introducing the OpenFlux Component Framework
layout: post
---
<p>OpenFlux is now officially open-sourced and available at <a href="http://openflux.googlecode.com/">http://openflux.googlecode.com/</a>. If you haven't heard of it yet, I've included some information below. Please <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openflux/source/checkout">try it out</a>, join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openflux">mailing list</a>, and let me know what you think!</p>

<h4>What is OpenFlux?</h4>
<p>OpenFlux is an open-source Flex component framework which allows developers to create radically new and custom Flex components. It's based on the work seen in <a href="http://www.quietlyscheming.com">Ely Greenfield's</a> <i><a href="http://www.onflexwithcf.org/index.cfm/2007/10/19/Flex-Roadmap-presented-by-Ely-Greenfield--Videos"> Flex Roadmap</a></i> session (courtesy of <a href="http://www.onflexwithcf.org"> Jo√£o Fernandes</a>) and is inspired by design patterns found in WPF/Silverlight, as well as <a href="http://kuwamoto.org/2007/05/17/introducing-the-flexiblecontainer-component-aka-advanced-actionscript-refactoring-step-3/ ">example code</a> available from <a href="http://www.kuwamoto.org">Sho Kuwamoto</a>. I certainly can't say that it's going to be exactly the same as what you might expect from future versions of Flex, but it'll be a step in the right direction for your projects today. If you're not familiar with those links, here are a few descriptions which apply just as well.</p>

<p><strong>OpenFlux is an MVC Component Framework.</strong> Each component in OpenFlux is comprised of three core parts which work together to define the API (Model), graphics (View), and behavior (Controller) of a component. At first glance I'm sure this seems like it may be overkill for creating a component, and it does add a little bit of complexity. However, there is a huge advantage in that you can very quickly and easily add entirely custom graphics and/or behavior to a component without having to worry about rewriting or breaking the existing pieces.</p>

<p><strong>OpenFlux is a set of Components.</strong> It includes completely new Buttons, Lists, and ScrollBars in the first release. By mixing and matching the views, controllers,  interfaces, layouts, animations and utilities provided in OpenFlux you can create nearly any Button, ScrollBar, or List imaginable including Checkboxes, RadioButtons, TileLists, CircleLists, and more.</p>

<p><strong>OpenFlux is an Advanced Layout and Animation API.</strong> It introduces a new layout system for lists and related components. We're working very hard to make sure that this system is entirely extensible and shows at least as much thought as what went into the core framework. Watch out for some really interesting list examples soon.</p>

<p><strong>OpenFlux is Degrafa's Best Friend.</strong> Wondering how you're going to make all those cool custom views for your OpenFlux components? Yup, these two were so meant for eachother that OpenFlux comes with Degrafa baked in. Consider yourself fully empowered to make people call you a bold-faced lier when you tell them it really is a Flex app. This is way beyond styling, way beyond skinning, it's like we stole it from some future version of Flex or something.</p>

<h4>Why OpenFlux?</h4>
<p>The real purpose of OpenFlux is to be customized and used in your projects. Using a viewless component system means that you can create dramatically new and interesting components quickly and easily, without having to worry about breaking the other parts of the component. Ever spent days hacking away at the Accordian, TabNavigator, or List components? Me too, that's why I built this. The answer isn't to make everything protected, it's to have a better component model!</p>
