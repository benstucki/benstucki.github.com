title: Sparkle vs. Flex

<p>And the winner is... Sparkle! You heard it here first. Sparkle relies on the power of the .NET framework and new Windows Presentation Foundation. It smells like a new car and even has its very own public beta. Next time you need to release an application to a controlled group of Windows users (such as a corporate intranet) where cutting edge design is a top priority (such as never), Sparkle is the tool for you. On a side note, I'm thinking about developing an application in Sparkle to display my Flash experiments. Is there a chance this would rip a hole in the fabric of space and time?</p>
