title: Introducing Reflex and the Future of Rich Internet Applications
layout: post
---
<p>If you're at all interested in the future of Rich Internet Applications, it's time you heard about the Reflex project. Reflex is, in short, a light-weight toolkit for developing application in MXML or AS3 WITHOUT Flex. That's right - no Flex.</p>

<p>Tyler Wright and I were on hand at 360|MAX last week to unveil plans for the framework on Adobe's own turf. It's still very early and there's not a lot of code to work with yet, but we were able to answer some basic questions.</p>

<p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Is Reflex pure AS3 or built on top of the Flex framework SDK?</dt>
		<dd>Reflex is written in both MXML and AS3, but DOES NOT use the Flex framework (think tiny swfs)</dd>

		<dt>Are Reflex components based on composition or inheritance?</dt>
		<dd>Reflex favors composition over inheritance almost religiously</dd>

		<dt>What is the estimated swf size of a Reflex application?</dt>
		<dd>Reflex is pay-as-you-go, so size will vary depending on how many features you use. Our goal is to include Buttons, ScrollBars, Containers and Lists at around 40 - 80 kb all together.</dd>

		<dt>Does Reflex use Flash Player 10</dt>
		<dd>Yes. Reflex will not work in FP9 or below.</dd>

		<dt>Do you plan to compete with Flex?</dt>
		<dd>Yes, we plan to compete with Flex</dd>

		<dt>When?!</dt>
		<dd>Expect a preview release in December and a Beta early next year.</dd>
