<p><strong>Software Engineer &#8211; Full Time / Contract-to-Hire &#8211; Salary: ~$80,000 (depending on experience), Franklin TN</strong></p>

<p>Daio (<a href="http://daio.com">http://daio.com</a>) is looking for a high-quality developer to help foster the best dev-culture in Nashville while building software of consequence for the designer/developer community. Contact ben@daio.com if this sounds like you.</p>

<p>
	<strong>You must&#8230;</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>know the web top-to-bottom: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax should all be second nature to you.</li>
		<li>have programming skills: You don&#8217;t have to know Node.js, but you&#8217;ve got to be a great programmer in *some* language and be willing and able to become one in Node.js.</li>
		<li>find an exhilarating beauty in discovering a simple solution to a complex problem. DRY &amp; KISS should be your daily mantras.</li>
		<li>know by experience that whatever you donâ€™t understand you can learn quickly.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>We can teach you&#8230;</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>the specifics of Node.js &amp; MySQL.</li>
		<li>to render and modify graphics using the HTML5 Canvas APIs.</li>
		<li>to keep things synchronized using the HTML5 Socket APIs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&#8230; but it&#8217;d be really nice if you&#8217;ve done some of it already too.</p>
</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be employee #2 &#8211; working directly with the company&#8217;s founder (that&#8217;s me). I&#8217;ll be building the mobile apps, so I hope to be your co-worker more than your boss. We have continuous integration (Jenkins) and version control (Git) already setup for you when you walk in the door.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Qualifications:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>You strive to do work you can be proud of.</li>
		<li>You do what you say and say what you do.</li>
		<li>You can recall the appropriate Simpsons or Futurama quote for any occasion.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>What is Daio?</strong></p>
<p>Daio (Design Assisted I/O) is building the future of interaction design software. Why are we prototyping mobile apps with software that&#8217;s meant to make swimsuit models glisten? Why are we still sending design files back and forth as attachments? Daio believes that mockups &amp; prototypes are the best form of communication for interactive projects, but competitors like Basecamp, Trello, Fogbugz and others don&#8217;t do them justice. We&#8217;ll be working on a SaaS product for teams of designers, developers, and others to collaborate on interactive projects. We can do better, and we&#8217;re going to &#8211; with your help.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Why work at Daio?</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Autonomy: We&#8217;ll work closely at first, but you&#8217;ll be in charge of your own projects and day-to-day work soon enough. We&#8217;ll bring more devs in eventually, but you won&#8217;t be in charge of them &#8211; you&#8217;ll just be a few months ahead of them.</li>
		<li>Mastery: We&#8217;re building a company of doers &#8211; software craftsmen and craftswomen who are constantly learning from each-other. When you feel you&#8217;ve got the web covered, we&#8217;ll have a whole new world of server algorithms, mobile development, and data visualizations for you to pick-up.</li>
		<li>Purpose: You&#8217;ll be working to build futuristic collaboration tools for designers. It&#8217;s not a bad gig.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Bonus: Your company will TRY to operate like Valve as it grows. Have you read the handbook? I have.</p>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Next steps.</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>We have a brief meeting/call to see if I want to work with you and you want to work with me.</li>
		<li>I&#8217;ll bring you in for a 4 or 5 hour technical interview and ask you to do some coding exercises.</li>
		<li>There is no step three.</li>
	</ol>
