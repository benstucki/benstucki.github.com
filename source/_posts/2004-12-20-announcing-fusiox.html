	 <strong>Announcing Fusiox.com! [ Mon, 20 Dec 2004 07:15:06 PM GMT ]</strong><br/>
     Fusiox.com will finally be live on 1/1/2005, followed shortly by a beta offering of the "FX Scrolling Gallery Extension" for Macromedia Dreamweaver in mid January. I have added a scrolling gallery example above which pulls photos dynamically from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308033710/http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr.com</a>. The beauty of using an FX Gallery is that it allows users to define flash displays in FXML (an XML language similar to HTML). This means that impressive flash displays can be created as easily as inserting an image on a website. FXML can also be used to define non-standard objects, such as context menus. In the example above users may right click to find a context menu option labeled 'Find Flickr Images by Keyword'. This context option is not built into the Flash file, but is instead defined in FXML. To get a sneak peek at the FXML being used <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308033710/http://blog.benstucki.net/photos.cfm" target="_blank">click here</a>. You may need to click 'View' &gt; 'Page Source' in your browser to view the XML correctly. I have also added a few <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308033710/http://www.benstucki.com/blog/galleryPreview1.htm" target="_blank">screenshots</a> of the upcoming Dreamweaver Extension. With this, designers can create flash gallery displays visually. Developers will also be able to utilize the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308033710/http://www.fusiox.com/fxml" target="_blank">FXML Dictionary</a> and Fusiox Tutorials in development to create more advanced and dynamic content. Feel free to comment if you have any feedback or questions, and I look forward to bringing you other quality products in the future.
