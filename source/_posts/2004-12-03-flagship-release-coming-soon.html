	 <strong>Flagship release coming soon [ Fri, 3 Dec 2004 12:00:00 PM GMT ]</strong><br/>
     I'm very happy to announce the tentative release of Fusiox's first product in early January. Our first release will be the "FX Scrolling Gallery Extension" for Macromedia Dreamweaver. Though I can't say much more about it at this time, there will be a preview, screenshots, and full information concerning this product on Dec. 20th, 2004. I understand that most of us will be celebrating the holidays, but it should definitely be worth taking a look at as soon as you get a chance.
