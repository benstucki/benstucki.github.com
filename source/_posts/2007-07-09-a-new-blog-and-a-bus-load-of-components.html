title: A New Blog and a Bus-load of Components
layout: post
---
<p>As the <a href="http://onair.adobe.com/">Adobe onAIR Bus Tour</a> rolls from town to town, I'll be playing along at home by posting a bus-load of components and code samples. <strike>Each time the bus stops for a full day event, I'll release a new component or library. Each night event is good for a code sample or technical post. This means I'll be releasing eight components and ten code samples over the next three months.</strike></p>

<p>I've updated my blog to get ready for all the action and managed to hassle <a href="http://www.rewindlife.com/">Chafic</a> into getting the new <a href="http://labs.atellis.com/">Atellis Labs</a> up and running last week. I even conned my way onto the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flexlib/">FlexLib</a> contributors list a while back. You can expect a lot of the components to find a rightful home outside of this blog, although I plan to talk about each of them here.</p>

<p><strike>Just like the bus tour, the component releases will kick off tomorrow, keep trucking through August (including a big release at <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/">360Flex</a>) and lead up to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/events/max/">Adobe Max</a> in September.</strike></p>

<p><strong>Updated 05/28/2008</strong> So I didn't get most of these blog posts out the way I wanted to, but you can see a lot of the code finding it's way into the community through projects such as <a href="http://www.degrafa.com">Degrafa</a>, <a href="http://openflux.googlecode.com">OpenFlux</a>, and <a href="http://metaphile.googlecode.com">Metaphile</a>. There's also a number of unfinished components and experimentation available through <a href="http://benstucki.googlecode.com">my personal googlecode project</a>.</p>
