<p>A lot of good tech bloggers like to share what they've learned at conferences and such, so I thought I would try it out. Here is what I learned from yesterday's events.</p>

<p>Microsoft Developers Network Event:
<ol>
	<li>Microsoft would like to reinforce the idea that developing mobile applications is just like developing desktop applications. Sort of like when they tell everyone that developing web applications is just like developing desktop applications. I will selectively forget that either claim was ever made.</li>
	<li>VB developers exist in great quantities and always ask questions specific to whatever project they happen to be working on at the time.</li>
	<li>Sparkle deserves some attention as a Windows application design tool, but anyone who calls it a Flash killer deserves some attention as an idiot. They probably got scared of Central eyeing their desktop space and deemed Sparkle a Flash killer because it could make things look pretty.</li>
	<li>XAML = No CSS: Who decided that was a good idea? Did we not learn anything from other markup languages?</li>
	<li>Microsoft spends an unimaginable amount of effort in making cool stuff like Cider and Sparkle. They spend a lot of money shipping people from town to town showing loyal developers how it will work. Then, they give demos that were put together in under ten minutes. It's marketing genius!</li>
</ol></p>
<p>
Nashville ColdFusion Users Group Meeting:
<ol>
	<li>Jesse Warden loves Flex.</li>
	<li>The ColdFusion developer to facial hair ratio in Nashville is high.</li>
	<li>Don't count your pizza until it's delivered</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Conclusion: The number of people that have a firm understanding of both .NET and FLEX is very small, but hopefully the number of .NET shops that gain an interest in Flex is large. $$$</p>
