title: A Workaround for Running the Flex 2 Beta on Windows Vista
layout: post
---
<p>Technically, the Flex 2 Beta itself runs great on Vista. The installer, on the other hand, does not. If you want to run the Flex 2 Beta on Windows Vista, you'll need to install it on an XP box somewhere first and then copy the application folder over. You'll also need to copy the debug player files out of your browser's plug-in folder to get debugging to work. Once everything is in place though, it should run without any trouble.</p>
