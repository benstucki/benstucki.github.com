<p>Last week I had the chance to hang out at 360|Flex Indianapolis and talk about the Flash 10 Sound API. <a href="http://www.360flex.com">360|Flex</a> conferences are always fantastic, and shame on anyone who wasn't there. :-) For those of you who missed the session or want to see the notes, I've provided the slides and example code below. The goal of the session was to provide not only an overview of the API but also a short primer on the Digital Signal Processing knowledge you'll need to really use it. During the conference I also had a chance to announce my new startup <a href="http://audiospike.com">AudioSpike</a> and the <a href="http://audiospike.com/opensource">AudioSpike Open-Source Initiative</a>, which includes open-source code for dynamically generating and visualizing audio on the web using Flash Player 10. Here's a quote from the <a href="http://blog.audiospike.com/2009/05/the-audiospike-opensource-initiative/">AudioSpike blog</a> describing the release.</p>

<p><blockquote>Our roots as a startup are in open-source technology and this effort allows us to give back to the community that got us started while also fostering a developer community around audiospike.com that can only make it better. The initial release includes our core AS3 dynamic audio engine called Audiophile as well as a set of Audio Visualization tools called AudioVision.</blockquote></p>

<p>We're always improving these libraries, so you can expect me to post more about it as the projects progress. Enjoy!</p>
