<p>I realize that the conference ended more than a month ago, but I couldn't go without having this awesome video posted on my blog. Flash on the Beach was easily the best conference I've attended, ever. If you've been passing it up because you're in the states, maybe you should keep an eye out for <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/">FOTB Miami</a> in April.</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for the general lack of updates and responsiveness lately. If I haven't gotten back to you about something in the last few weeks (or months) feel free to send me another email. More news on <a href="http://blog.audiospike.com">what I've been up to</a> later. :-)</p>
