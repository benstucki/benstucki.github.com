title: May is the Month of Flex
layout: post

<p>This month's topic is going to be Adobe Flex 2. I feel comfortable in Flex right now, so it's a good starting point for the new blog format. In addition to posting all about Flex this month, I'm going to release one completely free, open source Flex component each week in May. I feel like some of my best works have been locked inside the confines of corporate intranets over the years, so I think it's time to start getting some code out to the community. Expect the first one in the next few days.</p>
