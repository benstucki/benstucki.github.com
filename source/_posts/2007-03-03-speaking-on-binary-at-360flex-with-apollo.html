title: Speaking on Binary at 360Flex (with Apollo!)
layout: post
---
<p>I'm really excited about the 360Flex conference next week. I'm going to be giving a session titled "ByteArray 101" Monday afternoon, which will introduce binary data and how it can be used in Flex and Apollo applications. Having access to binary information is one of the most powerful features in the Flash Platform and opens a lot of possibilities. It's  even more powerful on the desktop with Apollo. The session doesn't require prior knowledge of what binary is. I'll cover the basics of binary information, how to read it in Flex and Apollo, and what it all means. I've got some cool demos lined up and really think this session will fundamentally change the way you look at Flex.</p>

<p>If you're going to make it out, feel free to post questions or expectations of what you want from this session. I can't promise it'll happen, but I'll at least talk to you afterward.</p>
