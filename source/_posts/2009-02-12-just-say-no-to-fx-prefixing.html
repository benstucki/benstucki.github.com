title: Just Say No to Fx Prefixing!
layout: post
---
<p>This week the Flex team is debating a key issue for the future of Flex and they're <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.59b7cdf0/26?@51.h7zqiubP349@">asking for input</a> from the community (that's you!). The debate is whether components in the next version of Flex should all start with the letters "Fx" or use namespaces to resolve possible conflicts with legacy components like Button, Panel and ScrollBar. Can you guess what I think?</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.benstucki.net/images/fk-icon.png" width="120" height="120" align="right" /> There are a few things that really, really bug me about all this. The first is how simple it should be. There is a single correct answer to this problem and it's namespaces. Namespaces and packages are the standard, well defined, commonly accepted solution for this exact problem. The people behind Flex are smart guys and girls and they know that, but somehow we ended up here anyways. Why is this even a debate?! The answer is, I speculate, because the shortcut (Fx prefixing) was faster. It fit within Adobe's timeframe and/or allowed them to include more features in the next release. To say it another way, the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Gumbo+Namespaces">ARCHITECTURE REVIEW BOARD</a> passed measures which every member knew went against W3C, OOP, and even Flex's own pre-existing standards so that they could put more features in the next release - and that scares the hell out of me.</p>

<p>The second item which, again, really bugs me is how it was handled. Somewhere along the path of building Flex 4 this issue came up and was debated, at length, behind closed doors at Adobe with, perhaps, a lot of speculation thrown in about how developers would actually respond. For the record, the answer is that we would respond poorly. Now, that's not actually a new process or anything, and I should point out that it's happened with all kinds of other decision that we've been perfectly happy with. However, when the verdict for this decision was rolled out and the community had a chance to respond with an appropriate "WTF?", the response from Adobe was increasingly poor. This decision was a done deal, development for it was complete, scoping for new features in this release was done. After years of evangelizing to make sure this technology was more than just a job to us, we were helpless to see it falter. In reality Adobe does and should have that right, but it still scares the hell out of me - and the fact that I have to rationalize how unimportant this is against the reality of what's important in life - that <em>should</em> really scare the hell out of Adobe. The disenfranchisement of your core audience is Not a good prospect.</p>

<p>... but there may be hope. Last week Adobe <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.59b7cdf0/26?@51.h7zqiubP349@">reopened discussions</a> concerning the topic and promised to reconsider the issue. I'm urging Adobe to simply value the opinions of it's developer community. Please, if you want to have a say in the matter make sure your voice is heard soon. They plan to make a decision as early as tomorrow!</p>
