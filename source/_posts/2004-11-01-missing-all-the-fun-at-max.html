	 <strong>Missing all the Fun at MAX [ Mon, 1 Nov 2004 12:00:00 PM GMT ]</strong><br/>
     Today begins the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050205212420/http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/events/max/" target="_blank">MAX 2004</a> conference, which I can't attend again this year. However, keeping up with the blogs I have seen a video demonstrating a few features of the next Flash player. I'm very excited to see actionscript controlled image effects, mainly blurring and shadowing. This is something that I've been waiting on for a long time, and you can be sure that you will see this slip into the FX Gallery products as soon as I get my hands on the next version of Flash.
