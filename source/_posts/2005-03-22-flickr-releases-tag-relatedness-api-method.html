	 <strong>Flickr Releases Tag Relatedness API Method [ Tue, 22 Mar 2005 03:53:08 AM GMT ]</strong><br/>
	 
		
	 
     Ludicorp has been getting allot of attention due to their recent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407001058/http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/03/yahoo_actually_.html" target="_blank">acquisition by Yahoo</a>, and it hasn't all been good. So perhaps it is just good timing that a number of Flickr API wishes have been granted recently, including the release of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407001058/http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2004/10/new_features_ta.html" target="_blank">tag relatedness</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407001058/http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.tags.getRelated.html" target="_blank">api method</a>. Apparently the relatedness algorithm considers countless user interactions to <i>learn</i> how tags are related. Which makes this the first api method to reveal Flickr's social intelligence to independent developers. Whereas any other method is fairly strait forward in getting an individual's photos or contacts, this one represents the human equation which has created so much buzz. I think it shows Flickr's willingness to share a little bit of it's genius with the world and gives me assurance that I will be Flickring for quite a while longer. Now if only we could play with that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050407001058/http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2004/11/interesting_.html" target="_blank">interestingness</a> api.
