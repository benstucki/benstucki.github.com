title: Flex Font Embedding

<p>Recently I released the <a href="http://labs.atellis.com/2007/07/11/atellis-reflection-component/">Atellis Reflection Component</a> on <a href="http://labs.atellis.com/">Atellis Labs</a>, and I've been meaning to post a few follow up topics. The first is on a common issue with embedded fonts in Flex.</p>

<p>The reflection component uses the BitmapData class to copy and manipulate an image of the area being reflected, and a small limitation of using BitmapData is that client side fonts don't show up in the resulting image. No problem though, just embed a font and use it as the default font for the application. Sounds easy, but be sure you embed the bold face for your font as well. This is a hard to find technique that will make sure all the text in your application is using the embedded font.</p>

<p>
{% highlight css %}
@font-face {
	src: local("Arial");
	fontFamily: ArialEmbedded;
	fontWeight: normal;
}

@font-face {
	src: local("Arial");
	fontFamily: ArialEmbedded;
	fontWeight: bold;
}

Application {
	font-family: ArialEmbedded;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Embedding fonts can increase the size of your swf files significantly.</p>
