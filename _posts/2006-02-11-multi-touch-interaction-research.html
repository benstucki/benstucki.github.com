<p>If you haven't seen <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirtouch/">this</a> already, you need to. Besides being incredibly cool, I think it holds a viable future in user input. While I was watching the video, I wondered why the interaction seemed so natural. I looked at my hand on the mouse for a second and then at my other hand. That's when I had the most mind numbingly stupid realization of my life. I literally thought, "Holy Crap, I have two hands!" It's just natural for us to interact with both hands and all of our fingers. It's like we've been using computers with one hand tied behind our backs. If you follow <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirsense/">this link</a>, it also states that it's based on fingerprinting technology. So I guess fingerprint logons would be a given, but what about simultaneous use? Could we authorize individual actions based on the fingerprint used to do the action? Consider such a use on a <a href="http://www.siemens.com/index.jsp?sdc_p=fmls5uo1319379ni1083537pcz3">paper-thin display</a>. I think we're getting ready for a serious change in how people interact with technology over the next decade.</p>
