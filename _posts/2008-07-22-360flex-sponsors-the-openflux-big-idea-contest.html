<a href="http://www.openflux.org" />OpenFlux</a> is getting ramped up for some exciting new demos at <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/">360Flex San Jose</a>, but we're still waiting for that one component that really shows what the framework is capable of. Luckily for us the guys at 360 conferences decided to sponsor the official OpenFlux Big Idea Contest. Here's how it works.</p>

OpenFlux makes it so easy to build custom components that we'll prove it. We want to see your best component ideas and designs. You come up with it, and we'll build it. Entries can be submitted as pencil sketches, design mock-ups, or even plain text. The submission with the most votes at the end of the contest takes home a PlayStation 3 courtesy of 360Flex!</p>

<p>The contest deadline will extend past the 360Flex San Jose conference, but you'll need to be in the audience on Wednesday to hear the final deadline. That means you'll have plenty of time to learn more about OpenFlux in San Jose and even develop your own OpenFlux components! A fully functional component is a valid submission of course, but remember that your entry could still get out-voted by that one solid idea scribbled on the back of a napkin. I like to think that this is what OpenFlux is all about. It makes sure that framework details don't get in the way of good ideas and helps developers become innovators. Once you have the ability, there's only one question left... what's the big idea?</p>
