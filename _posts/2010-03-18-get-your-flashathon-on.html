title: Get Your Flashathon On!
layout: post
---
<p>I had the chance to contribute some experimental Flash code to the annual <a href="http://galaxygoo.ning.com/forum/categories/galaxygoo-flashathon/listForCategory">GalaxyGoo Flashathon</a> this year, along with the likes of <a href="http://www.automatastudios.com/">Branden Hall</a>, <a href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/">Keith Peters</a>, <a href="http://www.levitated.net/">Jared Tarbell</a> and others. Not a bad crowd! <!--more--> Now it's your turn to grab the code, modify it, and make your own contribution. There are some awesome prizes up for grabs including a conference pass to <a href="http://www.flashbelt.com/">Flashbelt</a>! This is probably the best odds you'll see at a free conference pass, so grab it while you can.</p>

<p>Check out my contribution below, and then get started with your own by following the direction here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yaffuqa">http://tinyurl.com/yaffuqa</a></p>

[P - Pause, F - Full Screen, O - Open File (for color sampling), S - Save Image.]

<p>This is my original Flashathon contribution. Just click on it to get started. You'll be prompted to select an image for color sampling (no upload required), and then click some more to generate particles. Press "f" for full screen and "s" when you want to grab a snapshot.</p>
