title: Updated Bitmap3D Component for Flex 2 Beta 3
layout: post
---
<p><a href="http://lab.benstucki.net/archives/pixel3dexplorer/"><img src="http://lab.benstucki.net/images/Pixel3D1.jpg" alt="Image of Pixel3D Experiment" width="100" height="100" align="left" /></a>I've been updating some of my older work for the Flex 2 Beta 3 Player and wanted to point out that my <a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?id=9">Pixel3D Experiment</a> is now updated for Beta 3 and free for any use. It includes two components, Bitmap3D and Pixel3D. The Bitmap3D component is used to display any BitmapData object in 3D. Methods and properties are available for changing the rotation angles, image quality (for speed) and pixel by pixel depth values. The less useful Pixel3D component extends Bitmap3D and manipulates each pixel's depth based on color. Any help that can be given to increase the speed or capability of these components is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Also, I noticed that my captchas have been broken for a little while. They should be working now, so feel free to go back and comment on the last few entries.</p>
