title: Apollo Example Code and 360Flex Session Slides
layout: post
---
<p><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/">Apollo's out</a> and I can finally release source code from the ByteArray101 session I gave at 360Flex. This session really showed the power of Flex and Apollo and was very well received. Here's <a href="http://www.nodans.com/index.cfm/2007/3/5/ByteArray101-with-Ben-Stuki">a write up of the session from Dan Wilson</a> and <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=700">a favorable mention from Ryan Stewart</a>. In the session I gave an overview of binary data and how to manipulate it using the ByteArray class in Flex. More importantly I walked attendees through some real world code that actually pulls the cover art image out of an mp3 file (yep, cover art images are normally in there). Now you can download the Apollo code yourself and get more comfortable with the new found file access you have in Apollo. I've also included the slides from my presentation. Please note that while the sample code given will work with most mp3 files, it's not robust enough for a production application. A library for that is <a href="http://metaphile.googlecode.com/">on its way soon</a>.</p>
