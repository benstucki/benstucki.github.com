<p>I'm excited to be speaking at the Nashville Flex/Flash Camp this Friday, June 19th. If you're within driving distance and interested in learning the latest Flash and Flex technology, I'd definitely recommend checking it out - plus there's free beer. :-) I'll be talking about some of the more interesting and powerful features introduced to the Flash Player in the last few years including ByteArrays, BitmapData, and Sound APIs. Here's the official description.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<h5>Cool Stuff with Flex 4 and the Flash Platform</h5>
		From ByteArrays to Sound APIs the Flash Player has grown a lot in the last few years. In this talk Ben will take a look at Flash Platform features you may not even know existed and show you how to use them in the latest Flex 4 SDK.

<p>Adobe evangelist Greg Wilson will also be on hand to talk about about some of the changes coming to the Flash and Flex Frameworks.
