title: Free ID3Stream and ID3Reader Components for Flex 2
layout: post
---
<p>Another set of completely free and open source Flex 2 components are ready for download. Before I go into detail about these, let me explain what I think makes them unique. I've read a lot about using rich internet applications as a replacement for desktop applications, but there aren't many examples out there yet. Unfortunately, the examples I do see are mostly graphical mock-ups of Microsoft Windows. When I personally consider using the Flash Platform for ubiquitous desktop applications I don't think about constraining the user interface, instead I consider how the ByteArray class may be used to read and manipulate files. The ID3Stream and ID3Reader classes are just a few examples of the untapped power that is in Flex.</p>

This allows users to view the MP3's metadata quickly without having to download the whole file (downloads about 40kb as opposed to 4mb).</p>

<p><strong>The ID3Reader Component</strong> is used to parse the raw bytes of an ID3 tag into an array of AS3 objects. It is capable of parsing frame types that the core ID3 object can't yet, including embedded images.</p>
