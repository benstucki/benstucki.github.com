title: See You at 360|Flex Atlanta
layout: post
---
<p>I'm going to be in Atlanta next week for the always incredible <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/">360|Flex conference</a>. I'll be introducing a few of the new open source projects that I've been working on, as well as fielding questions on <a href="http://www.degrafa.com/">Degrafa</a> at <a href="http://scalenine.com/blog/">Juan's</a> session. I've copied my own session description below, followed by a few others that I'm dying to attend.</p>

<p><strong>Reinventing Flex</strong>
Big changes lie ahead for Flex. Are you ready? In this session Ben will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Flex, hypothesize on the new development approaches we may see in future versions, and demonstrate the use of these forward thinking approaches in Flex applications today. Ben will also introduce OpenFlux, a framework for creating radically custom components in dramatically less time, and Plexiglass, an unreleased project that promises to bring 3D to the Flex community. Come ready for a few surprises, and walk away with a completely new perspective on Flex development.</p>

<p>
Here are a few more sessions where you're likely to see me in the audience.

</ul>

<p>The thing I really love about 360|Flex is that although the sessions are some of the best, the real fun is in the off the cuff hallway and mid-party conversations that go on. With so many of the top Flex developers just hanging around for three days, you can't help but walk away with a better understanding of Flex. I've heard inside info that the tickets are starting to fly out the door. So if you've been sitting on the fence, you'd better move fast! <a href="http://360flex.eventbrite.com/">Register</a> before they're gone, and I'll see you there.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've posted my presentation slides <a href="http://www.benstucki.net/sessions/ReinventingFlex.pdf">here</a>. The code samples will be in separate posts.</p>
