<p>I'm happy to announce that <a href="http://tnw.to/188vp">I'll be participating</a> in the <a href="http://jumpstartfoundry.com/2011/05/05/ready-set-go/">Jumpstart Foundry</a>, a seed stage funding and mentoring program here in Nashville. As part of my business I plan to create a tool that helps designers build apps for iOS and Android devices (using the Reflex component framework). I probably won't be releasing much more information until after the program is complete. So if you're a designer with an interest in mobile apps or a fellow entrepreneur with big ideas on where this should go, feel free to send an email to mail [at] benstucki.net in the meantime - or sign up for an alpha invite <a href="http://reflex.io/?page_id=10">here</a>.</p>
