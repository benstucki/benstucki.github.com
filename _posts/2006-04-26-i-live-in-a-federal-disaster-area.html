<p>A few weeks ago I found myself in close proximity to an F3 tornado. My manager collected some photos of the damage near our building, which I've finaly uploaded. News of the storms got national coverage after it hit, so I thought these pics would be worth posting. Plus I needed an excuse for not blogging in so long.</p>
