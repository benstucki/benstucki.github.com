title: SpatialKey on the Cover of ComputerWorld
layout: post
---
<p>SpatialKey is featured on the cover of this months ComputerWorld magazine, and in the feature article <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=Business+Intelligence&articleId=323822&taxonomyId=9&pageNumber=1">"Can Web 2.0 Save BI?"</a>. The article includes an interview with Chief Jon Greiner of the Ogden Police Department in Utah, which is the first police department in the country to implement an enterprise version of the <a href="http://lawenforcement.spatialkey.com/">SpatialKey Law Enforcement Dashboard</a>. In my <a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?p=50">last post</a> I described a few areas where I think SpatialKey sets itself apart from other mapping solutions, but nothing beats hearing it from a customer:</p>

<blockquote>Today, the officers are using the new BI tools to perform geographic profiling of crimes and analysis of police data "in seconds," he says. Before, it could take days for the department's single crime analyst to fulfill a report request. An added bonus is that experienced police officers with extensive street experience are now able to apply their firsthand knowledge to crime analysis.</blockquote></p>

<p>It's amazing to see the product I work on every day shown in such a broad-reaching publication in the IT industry. Maybe it's just the pretty visualizations that got it on the cover, but I'll take the contents of the interview as further proof that we're quite possibly making the best mapping product on the web.</p>
