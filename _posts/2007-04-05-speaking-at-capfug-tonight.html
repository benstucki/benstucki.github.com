title: Speaking at CAPFUG Tonight
layout: post
---
<p>I'll be speaking at the Capital Area Flex Users Group tonight on Working with Binary Data in Flex and Apollo. Here's the write up from <a href="http://www.dc-flex.com/">the dc-flex website</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote>This is a topic which is becoming much more important with the prospect of the Apollo Beta being released in early 2007. It will cover basic concepts, as well as provide in depth examples of adding support for new binary formats to flex.</blockquote></p>

<p>That sounds good to me. This will cover a lot of the same material that I presented in my <a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/?id=36">ByteArray 101</a> session at <a href="http://www.360flex.org/">360Flex</a>. Jonathan Rowny will also be speaking about <em>ActionScript 3 Objects, Projects, and Fisix Alpha</em>. I think the fisix alpha sounds especially interesting, so I guess I'll go. If you're in the area and can make it out, be sure to say hi.</p>
