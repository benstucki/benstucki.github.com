<p>If you weren't at the Birds of a Feather session for Papervision at MAX 2007 and you missed my session at 360 Flex Atlanta...</p>

<p>... you might not know that I've been playing with <a href="http://blog.papervision3d.org">Papervision3D</a> a lot lately. Most of that work is actually pretty useful, and well... the rest of it involves 3D glasses.</p>

<p>I've finally made the source for this experiment available for download. Plus, I've added all of the anaglyphic rendering code to my personal <a href="http://benstucki.googlecode.com/">googlecode project</a>. The example shown here was written on the "Phunky" Papervision branch, but the classes in googlecode should let you render anaglyphs for any version. If you have an older Papervision3D project, you just need to swap out the existing Scene3D with AnaglyphicScene3D. For newer projects using the GreatWhite release, use the AnaglyphicRenderEngine. Now that the code's available and all those glasses are out there, I expect to see some awesome 3D examples from you people!</p>
