title: Yes, I'm a Flex Consultant
layout: post
---
<p>I've started consulting full-time and wanted to mention it before making any other posts. For the past year I've had the honor of working with a great team at <a href="http://www.atellis.com/">Atellis</a>, and I feel like my time there was incredibly worthwhile. I contributed to some ground breaking Flex/.NET applications and got to learn from a few of the best developers around. However, a number of months ago my wife and I decided that it was time to move closer to our friends and family in Nashville and began making plans for the long trek back to Tennessee.</p>

<p>Today, I'm working out of our new house in fly-over country and seeing the amazing demand for Flex first hand. As I begin to schedule projects and learn the business side of things, I'm taking extra precautions to be sure that I have the time and money to give back to the Flash and Flex community that's given so much to me. So, expect more soon.</p>
