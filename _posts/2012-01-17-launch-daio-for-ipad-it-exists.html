<p><strong>What's happening</strong>: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daio/id491093976?ls=1&mt=8">DAIO for iPad</a> is for sale in the App Store.</p>

<p><strong>What it means to you</strong>: You can get in early and probably be my best friend for life by <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daio/id491093976?ls=1&mt=8">buying it</a> today.</p>

<p>It's been nearly eight months since diving back into the startup world solo, and DAIO for iPad has finally been released. To be honest, it's not as good as Adobe Proto (yet), and it's not as feature complete as AppCooker (yet) - but it exists - and just getting that far was pretty hard. If you have a chance to use it, drop me a line (ben@daio.com) to let me know what you think. Also, make sure to follow one of DAIO's many online accounts to get a sneak peek at what's next.</p>
