<p>In my last post I gave source to an ActionScript 3 class used to display <a href="http://www.id3.org/">ID3</a> APIC images in <a href="http://labs.macromedia.com/technologies/flexbuilder2/">Flex 2</a>. In it, I used a few MP3 files from a <a href="http://www.ryansmells.com/">friend</a>'s former band as examples and thought you might like to know where you can download some more. Take a quick trip over to <a href="http://www.imaginarybaseball.com/">imaginarybaseball.com</a> and visit their shows page. You'll see three albums worth of great music from under-appreciated Nashville talent. It's easy for good music to get overlooked in this area, so I wanted to take a moment and thank them.</p>
