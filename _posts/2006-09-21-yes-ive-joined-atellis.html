title: Yes, I've Joined Atellis
layout: post
---
<p>As you might have read on <a href="http://rewindlife.com/2006/09/01/ben-stucki-joins-the-atellis-team/">Chafic's blog</a>, I have officially joined Atellis and now find myself just outside the Washington, DC area. I'm already deep into some really awesome Flex and .NET work and sharpening my skills with a few of the best Flash, Flex and .NET experts in the industry. One of the things that interested me about this position is the company's focus on development. Atellis knows that architecture is important, user experience is important, and most of all developers are important. As a result of my new position I should have more opportunity to interact with the Flash and Flex communities, including a session with Chafic at FITC titled <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/presentation_detail.cfm?festival_id=10&presentation_id=387">Flash and Flex can hold hands</a>. Once I get settled in a bit more I'll get back into  regular blogging and code samples as well. Also, we're still looking for more developers. If you like developing cool stuff and want to innovate, I fully recommend contacting Chafic about our open positions.</p>
