title: Flash and Flex can Hold Hands Session Notes
layout: post
---
<p>Last week I was hanging out at FiTC in Hollywood and had a blast. There were some <a href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=879">very cool</a> <a href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=880">sessions</a> that have made it onto the web already. So after procrastinating for a week or so, I'm finally posting my slides for the <a href="http://www.benstucki.net/sessions/fitc_flash_flex.ppt">Flash and Flex can Hold Hands</a> session that <a href="http://www.rewindlife.com/">Chafic</a>  and I gave. Obviously Flex has a lot to offer for developers and I think it's a giant leap in the right direction, but now there's a lack of focus on where designers fit in and why they're so desperately needed. I've heard a lot of complaining around the concept that all Flex applications look the same, and people continue to believe that this argument holds weight. Flex applications have a lot more graphics capability than standard web apps, but I haven't heard anyone complaining that web applications all look the same. The difference is that designers are part of the process in creating web pages, but for some reason we've left them out of our Flex applications. This session gave us an hour to touch the surface of using flash to improve your Flex application design, and hopefully it will help a few more people when it's floating around the web.</p>
