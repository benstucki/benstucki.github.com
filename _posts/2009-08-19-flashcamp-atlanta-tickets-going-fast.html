<p><a href="http://flashcampatlanta-badges.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://s3.davidtucker.net/atl_speaker_badge-250.png" width="250" border="0" align="right" style="margin-left: 20px;" /></a>I'm excited to be speaking at FlashCamp Atlanta next Friday, August 28th, on "The Art and Science of Rich Internet Applications". Here's the official description from the <a href="http://events.universalmind.com/page.cfm/flash-camp-atlanta-2009">FlashCamp Atlanta website</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote>Rich Internet Applications are the newest boardroom buzzword, but what does R.I.A. mean to the Flash and Flex developers who actually make applications? In this session Ben will explore the Science of User Experience Design, the Art of Application Architecture and the real world lessons for buzzwords in-between.</blockquote></p>

<p>This is the first time I'll be giving this session, and I'm excited to see what people think. I've been doing a variety of RIA work for the past several years, and it occurred to me that there's a level of understanding between "We need to be more Web 2.0" and "Debugging the UIComponent Lifecycle" that's largely missing. I've also found that, contrary to popular belief, User Experience Design isn't always just intuition, and Application Architecture sometimes is. My session is aimed at addressing both of these issues by presenting what's uniquely challenging about building RIAs, how to <em>feel</em> your way through the development process, and how a few <em>golden rules</em> can make or break your design.</p>

<p>If you want to catch this session plus a day full of other great content, make sure to sign up at <a href="http://www.flashcampatlanta.com">www.flashcampatlanta.com</a> before it's sold out. If you're a short drive away (like me) then there's no excuse to miss it.</p>
