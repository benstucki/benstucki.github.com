title: 360Flex DC - It's going to Rock!
layout: post
---
<p>360|Flex is THE conference for Flex developers and now it's on the east coast. In case any east coasters aren't familiar with <a href="http://www.360flex.com/">360|Flex</a>, this is NOT that conference where suits go to learn cloud computing buzzwords. It's not where you pay to have hundreds of corporate sponsors sell you their latest API. This is where Flex developers go to meet, hang out with, and learn from other Flex developers like you. I would recommend that you go ahead and click on <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/680816340/360flexhelpsell/2637254454">this link</a> to get your ticket while you can, but  here are my top three reasons to see 360|Flex rock the east coast - just in case you need more convincing.</p>

<h3>3) General sessions worth the price of admission.</h3>
<p><img src="http://files.benstucki.com/360flex-dc/130249504-6146bafc074638f52b1994dd4efda432.4c3f4ca0-scaled-279x300.jpg" width="140" height="150" alt="Jesse vs. Jesse" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />I've been asking John to create general sessions for years, and I think these sessions alone are going to make 360|Flex DC worth seeing. Doug McCune, Jesse Warden, Jesse Freeman, Antonio Holguin, Chuck Freedman, Adam Flater... I even talked my way into a slot. These sessions might have been standing room only anyways, but now the pressure is really on for these speakers to bring their best. Trust me, I know.</p>

<h3>2) 360Flex-A-Palloza will Rock (in the more literal sense).</h3>
<p><img src="http://files.benstucki.com/360flex-dc/360flexapalooza-300x222.jpg" alt="360Flex-A-Palooza" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;" /> I'm also going to be rocking some piano and/or guitar Monday along with a few of the coolest Flex devs I know. 360|Flex parties are THE best place to talk tech, make connections, and relax with the only people in the world who think you still speak English. With 360Flex-A-Palooza the community is taking it to the next level and bringing you some musical geekery worth starting a conversation over.</p>

<h3>1) Flex Tech Overdose</h3>
<p>I see people completely overloaded on Flex knowledge at every 360|Flex - and that's a good thing. Don't think for a second that just because there's music, parties, and designer sessions that this isn't still the ONLY dedicated Flex conference around. I've been to every 360|Flex in the states and fresh, new devs are plugged into the community and getting the knowledge and resources they need to be successful in this field at every single one. It wasn't that long ago that the big names in Flex today were looking for jobs at a 360|Flex, and now it's your turn.</p>
